# small_code_challenges
A repository that contains selected solutions to small coding challenges (from e.g. Project Euler). <br/>
The problems have been chosen from interest and to fit with the curiculum of a curse that I was leading.

## Project Euler
https://projecteuler.net/ <br/>
Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve 
<br/>
Each problem have a separate python-file and is created to be run separately. The input data that is needed for some of the files are kept in project_euler\raw_data
<br/>
Don't look at these solutions if you struggle to solve a selected problem as it removes the satisfaction of solving it yourself

### Purpose and timeline
These problems where solved as I was developing/leading a Python and Data Science course at my job at the time (2018-2019)
